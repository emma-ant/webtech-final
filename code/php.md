echo just outputs the string passed to it.
example echo "Lorem ipsum" 

echo "I am unlucky <br>";
echo "Hater";

// this is a comment
   /*
   trying new 
   things everyday
   */
//variales hold data, string, integers etc

$name = "Cosmo ANd Wanda";
echo $name -> just outputs it
but echo "Hello {$name}" allows you to concat text to variables

$food = "peppercorn";

you can also put <br> and <hr> in the string in the php to make it do some html but not on its own
echo "{$val} <br>";


can also stor emails
$email = "foo@gmail.com";
    
text can also take numbers but cannot perform operations on it
echo "{val/3}" -> error

  
php varibles can stor float as well
$age = 221;
$root = 3.6677345

perform operations and stor to variables then echo said varibles
$val = $age/3;

use escape squence "$" when you wan to put $ nex to a php variable 

echo "Hello {$name}.You love {$food}?" ;
echo "<br>";

$online = false; 
echo "{$online}"
☝🏾 this displays nothing if false but one if true; mostly used internally


you can make a variable null then assign it to an operation with other variables
-basic operators apply: +, -, /, *, **, %
-incements: ++, +=[num]
-decrements: --, -=[num]
-precedence: BODMAS

//from iot
iiset()

//from class 
header("Location: [url]");
exit();
- takes you to the page specified in the url
