A website for holding discussions on sports

Welcome to athlitismós, a website for holding discourse on sports with publishers, subscribers who can comment and an admin profile to manage all users

the goal is to allow: 
subscribers to be able to lookup publishers and/or posts (search function), see all the posts per publisher, subscribe to a publisher, view all the publishers they have subscribed to and leave comments on a publisher's publication, (if possible, a little dot that indicates whether a post has been read and a catch up that shows all the posts from all the publisher's they have subscibed to but haven't read)

publishers to see how many subscribers they have, post new publications (potentially with images and embed youtube videos), see comments (and potentially read count)

admin can see the database, all users both publishers and subscibers, all posts, all subscriber lists, all comments per subsciber etc.
